Terrform provider for managing a context in Terraform. A context, in this case, is a set of key-value pairs that can
be used to enable or disable a module, as well as generating consistent resource names and tags for cloud resources.

## Introduction

Terrform provider for managing a context in Terraform. A context, in this case, is a set of key-value pairs that can
be used to enable or disable a module, as well as generating consistent resource names and tags for cloud resources.

This provider is intended to be a replacement for Cloud Posse's
[terraform-null-label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label) Terraform module as well as the
[context.tf](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/blob/main/exports/context.tf) export from that module,
which is copied into all of Cloud Posse's modules and components (root modules) via automation.

The provider is designed to be more flexible and easier to use than the `terraform-null-label` module, and to provide
a consistent way to manage context across all of Cloud Posse's modules and components via a provider, rather than a
Terraform module. This provider also allows flexibility in the property names that can be used to generate labels and
tags, where the previous module-based solution was limited to a fixed set of properties (namespace, tenant, stage,
environment, name and attributes).




## Usage

Here is how to use this provider in your own Terraform code:

```hcl
provider "context" {
  delimiter = "~"
  enabled   = false
  properties = {
    namespace   = {}
    tenant      = {}
    stage       = {}
    environment = {}
    name        = {}
  }

  property_order = ["namespace", "tenant", "stage", "environment", "name"]

  values = {
    "namespace"   = "cp"
    "tenant"      = "core"
    "stage"       = "prod"
    "environment" = "ue1"
    "name"        = "example"
  }
}

data "context_label" "example" {
  values = {
    "tenant" = "plat"
    "stage"  = "dev"
  }
}

data "context_label" "example" {
  template = "{{.namespace}}/{{.tenant}}/{{.stage}}/{{.name}}"
  values = {
    "tenant" = "plat"
    "stage"  = "dev"
  }
}
```
See the [Docs](./docs) for additional information.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.

- [Terraform Plugins](https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/plugin-types.html#providers) - Terraform is logically split into two main parts: Terraform Core and Terraform Plugins. Each plugin exposes an implementation for a specific service, such as the AWS provider or the cloud-init provider.
